## **AI Tools and OGPC**

AI tools are everywhere these days, and we want teams to be able to explore these tools while making sure OGPC remains about student creativity, effort, and the learning journey.

### **How to handle AI in your project**

**Document your AI usage for your Project**

If you use AI tools to generate code, create assets, or help with design, make sure to document and be ready to discuss:

* **Which tools you used** \- Name the specific AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.) and what you used them for  
* **What got AI assistance** \- Be specific about which parts of your project involved AI help. Did it write a pathfinding algorithm? Generate character sprites? Help brainstorm level designs? Give us the details.  
* **Your role in the process** \- How did you guide the AI? What prompts did you use? How many iterations did it take to get something useful?  
* **What you did with the AI output** \- Did you use the AI-generated code as-is, or did you modify it? How did you integrate AI-created assets with your own work? What did you learn from the process?  
* **Why did you choose AI for this task** \- Was it to tackle something outside your current skill set? To speed up a repetitive process? To explore creative possibilities?

Think of this documentation as showing your work \- just like in math class, we want to see your thinking process. The goal is to give yourself,  judges and other teams insight into how AI tools fit into your creative process.


**Be ready to explain everything** 

During judging, you should be able to walk through any AI-generated code and explain how it works, what it does in your game, and why you chose to use AI for that particular task. If AI helped write a function, you should understand what that function accomplishes and how it connects to your overall game design.

Judges will want to hear about your decision-making process. Why did you turn to AI for this piece? Was it to tackle something outside your current skill set? To speed up development so you could focus on other parts of your game? To explore a technique you'd heard about but never tried? How did you guide the AI to get useful results \- what kind of prompts worked, what didn't?

You should also be ready to discuss how AI-generated content fits into your bigger picture. If AI wrote your collision detection system, how does that work with your physics? If AI helped design a level layout, how does it support your game's progression? The goal is showing that you understand how all the pieces of your project work together, whether you created them yourself or had some AI assistance.

This applies beyond just code \- if AI generated art assets, sound effects, or helped with game design decisions, be prepared to talk through those choices too. What made the AI output useful for your project? How did you integrate it with your own creative vision?

**AI-generated assets work differently for achievements**

AI can help you create art, music, sound effects, and other assets, but only content created by team members counts toward the Art & Assets achievement requirements. Think of AI-generated assets like any other external resource \- they're totally fine to use in your game, but they won't help you earn points for artistic creation.

This means if you use AI to generate character sprites, background music, or sound effects, make sure to document that in your Game Portfolio just like you would for Creative Commons assets or public domain resources. You'll still need to create your own original assets to meet the achievement requirements \- but AI-generated content can supplement what your team makes.

During judging, be ready to talk about your AI-generated assets too. How did you prompt the AI to get what you wanted? How do the AI-created assets fit with your overall artistic vision? Did you modify them after the AI created them? This shows your creative decision-making process, even when AI was part of the workflow.

The goal is recognizing teams for developing their own artistic skills while still allowing AI tools to help bring your creative vision to life.

### **What doesn't need documentation**

Standard IDE features like autocomplete, spell check, and error highlighting are just part of modern development. Using AI to help you understand programming concepts or learn a feature in a game engine can be part of your learning process (just like watching a Youtube tutorial) and doesn’t require special documentation.

### **Why this approach**

Teams come to OGPC with different backgrounds and resources. AI tools might help teams tackle challenges they couldn't handle otherwise. Learning to work with AI tools is becoming part of modern development. Whether teams choose to use AI assistance or build everything from scratch, we're excited to see what you create \- there are many paths to building something amazing at OGPC.
