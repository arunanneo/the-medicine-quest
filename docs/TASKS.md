## How the Theme Connects

Johnny's journey across 3 biomes to collect herbs and save Grandpa Smith is a perfect fit for "Journeys." Make sure to emphasize:
- The physical journey across Plains → Forest → Snow Mountain
- Johnny's personal growth/transformation through challenges
- The emotional journey of saving a loved one
