## I \- Game Design Document

### **Game Title:**

*The Medicine Quest*

### **Game Summary:**

*This is a platformer game,where there are 3 levels each having 3 hidden ingredients per level. Johnny has to make a medicine from these ingredients at the end of the game to save his grandpa, Smith . Also along your way there are obstacles along the way.The journey of this is the finding of the ingredients,and creating the medicine.Each of these levels are different biomes.*

### **Target Audience:**

*This game is targeted for those who like platformers. It also is intended for people who like scavenger hunts. This game age area is ages 7+. This is also intended for those who like obbys and 2d games such as Mario .*

### **Gameplay Loop:**

*This is a hard but short platformer with levels representing different biomes and there are ingredients scattered through each level. You have to get enough of the ingredients needed to make the medicine.If you don't get the ingredients needed, you will lose the person you are giving the medicine to dying. If you do get the ingredients needed, you will win, and the person will survive.*

*The character starts with –  A knife, pistol and a bag and he can store things throughout the entire journey collecting the herbs. There could be*

*Level 1 Plains Biome-   Johnny the main character has to do some easy parkour and in the middle the item will be in a patch where Johnny collects it and stores it.*

*Level 2/4 Forest Biome- Like the last level you have to do some parkour and you have to attack animals such as a bear which you can trade the bear pelt to a Native American to obtain your next herb for level 2\. Level 4 is in more of a Drier time and **ONLY** if there is at least 5 weeks left after level 3 is full completed. A fire may break out and stuff deal lots more damage on fire. Level 4 is hard to program so probably not*

*Level 3/ Snowy Biome- Johnny will have to climb up a mountain and has to dodge powdered snow or else he will sink in and die. After getting past this level there will be a small tree at the top of the mountain which will have a leaf that will be the last herb for the medicine.*

*Brambles to hurt the player*

*Herb \#1*

*Herb \#2*

*Herb \#3*

*What the starting setting looks like*

*Base Tileset: Will be edited to make all three biomes*

### **User Interface:**

*THE MENU*

*The menu will have 4 buttons, **help**, **exit**, **play**,and **credits**. The **help** button tells the controls, the **exit** button makes you leave the game, the **play** button makes you play the game and the **credits** button tells you who does what role in the game. The **title** will be at the top of the menu. On the far left there will be the **play** button, next is the **help** followed by the **credits** then the **exit** button.*

*THE MAP*

*Grassy Planes, Snow Biome, and Some Forests.*

*Johnny has to deal with these to help Grandpa Smith.  Planes biome is parkour. Forests will be kinda hard, with more parkour,animals attacking you. Native Americans are there to trade, but you have to make sure that they are happy with the trades, or else they get really angry. Snow Mountains will be the hardest because you might freeze by hitting icicles, wind that will mess up your direction, AND you can encounter powdered snow. There will be a tree at the top, where you will get a herb.*

### **Sound and Music:**

*Piano played by Eshan and/or Kirin*

### **Technical Requirements:**

*We are making this game on Gamemaker Studio 2\. We are using Paint 3D and Piskel for the game*

### **Development Plan:**

*End of Oct \- Completed Game Portfolio*

*End of Nov \- Completed Storyboard*

*End of Dec \- Started Game and have all characters in the game. Completed 1st level.*

*End of Jan \- Finished level 2\. Also added music.*

*End of Feb \- Finished level 3*

*End of Mar \- Bug checks*

*End of Apr \- Finish bug checking*

*10 days into May \- Ready for Competition*

*We all live in different areas so we will be meeting with Zoom. This shall happen every Sunday, with 2 hour meetings. We also will keep track of what happens in those meetings with Notion,a meet tracker.*
